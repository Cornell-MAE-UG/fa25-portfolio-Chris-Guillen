This was a homework project where the goal was to design a mechanism to lift the maximum weight possible using an actuator to the maximum height possible using a rigid bar, 3 pins of which two had to be connected to the ground, and an actuator. The rest of the design can be found in assets as Portfolio 1, 2, and 3.
